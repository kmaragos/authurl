An easy way to retrieve the contents of a page accessible with cookie authentication, without using a cookie file.

It was built to get pages from private torrent trackers with a specific auth process:
1. A login form is presented to be filled with username and password
2. A user ID (uid) and pass code are returned in a cookie
3. Get the desired page, sending the cookie info in the request header
